# Fried Chicken
 A silly game I made with the time I had in quarintine. You can look at other's scores on an excel sheet as well. 
 It was made with Python and Pygame and uses some gspread to post the scores.

To see your's and everyone's scores go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PYDfT-goY9ghbXYXMV7r6XvG6IYOlyXZ9DcolY5Mbk/edit?usp=sharing

All the assets are available in a folder if you want to use them. A friend of mine and myself drew everything you see.

To run the program just open the file and run the main.exe (Application file)
