# Fried Chicken
A silly game I made with the time I had in quarantine. I just learned Python and wanted to practice with it and get an introduction to   game design. You can look at other's scores on an excel sheet as well. It was made with Python and Pygame and uses some gspread to post the scores.

To play the game, download the whole project as a zip, then extract all the files (it should ask you if you want to if your try to run anything). Then run the Fried Chicken Shortcut (or main.exe).

To see your's and everyone's scores go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PYDfT-goY9ghbXYXMV7r6XvG6IYOlyXZ9DcolY5Mbk/edit?usp=sharing.

Share the game with https://github.com/Tryston7/Fried-Chicken.

All the assets are available in a folder if you want to use them. A friend of mine and myself drew everything you see.

It might tell you that the program isn't safe because it's an .exe file, I can ensure you it is safe.
