# Fried Chicken
A silly game I made with the time I had in quarintine. I just learned Python and wanted to practice with it and get an introduction to   game design. You can look at other's scores on an excel sheet as well. It was made with Python and Pygame and uses some gspread to post the scores.

To see your's and everyone's scores go to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15PYDfT-goY9ghbXYXMV7r6XvG6IYOlyXZ9DcolY5Mbk/edit?usp=sharing

All the assets are available in a folder if you want to use them. A friend of mine and myself drew everything you see.

To run the program just run the Fried Chicken Shortcut (This is just the main.exe). It might tell you that the program isn't safe because it's an .exe file, I can ensure you it is safe.
